**1-Cars-Neural-network**
In this code, we wanted to train a dataset in the neural network and make predictions by regression. New tips:
- Structure of neural network model (epoch, neuron, optimizer, loss, compile, fit , layer , Sequential,...)
- Analysis of loss behavior and loss validation in train (for Overfitting)
- Dense layer for regression & Normalization layer
- Data analysis with seaborn & evaluate

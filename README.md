**1-Cars-Neural-network**
In this code, we wanted to train a dataset in the neural network and make predictions by regression. New tips:
- Structure of neural network model (epoch, neuron, optimizer, loss, compile, fit , layer , Sequential,...)
- Analysis of loss behavior (for set weights) and loss validation in train (for set hyperparameter & Not overfitting)
- Dense layer for regression & Normalization layer
- Data analysis with seaborn & evaluate

**2-breast-cancer-Neural**
In this dataset, we perform classification by neural network and predict the test data and measure the accuracy in training, testing and validation.
New items:
- optimizer, Adam or SGD?
- sigmoid layer & binary_crossentropy loss for  binary classification
- Scaling or Normalization?
